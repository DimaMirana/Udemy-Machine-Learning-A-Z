# Udemy-Machine-Learning-A-Z
This Repository contains all the codes I have implemented while completing the course 'Machine Learning A-Z' on Udemy. The code For chapter8- Deep Learning is not being uploaded with the datasets as the dataset are quite large. I have uploaded all the codes on this section though. If anyone need the dataset just message me. All the related information of each models, the graph and accuracy are well documented(not completed yet) are in the Machine Learning A-Z.pdf files. Thanks.
